/**
 * Runs an application's migrations, in the order their names sort --
 * the timestamp each name starts with -- and records each one run in the
 * `tinvar_migrations` table, with the batch it ran in, so a rollback can
 * take back the last deploy's and no more.
 *
 * Each migration runs in a transaction of its own where the database
 * allows schema changes in one (SQLite and Postgres), with its record
 * written in the same transaction: a migration that throws leaves neither
 * its changes nor its record, and the ones before it stay run. MySQL
 * commits every schema change as it runs, so there a failure leaves what
 * ran before it, and MigrationFailed lists that.
 *
 * Every run that changes anything holds the dialect's migration lock -- an
 * advisory lock on Postgres, a named lock on MySQL, a lock file beside a
 * SQLite database -- and reads what has run only once it has it, so two
 * deploys starting together migrate one after the other and the second
 * finds nothing left to do.
