     * busy connection fails at once instead of waiting its turn, and foreign
     * keys are not enforced at all -- so a REFERENCES clause in the schema
     * was decoration. WAL lets readers run beside the one writer; the busy
     * timeout queues writers instead of failing them; foreign_keys makes the
     * schema's references real.
     *
     * Commits are synced as $synchronous says, NORMAL unless told otherwise.
     * SQLite's default in WAL mode, FULL, syncs the log on every commit,
     * inside the write lock, so every writer waiting for that lock waits for
     * the disk as well. NORMAL syncs it at each checkpoint instead. The file
     * stays consistent either way; what NORMAL gives up is the last commits
     * before the machine itself loses power or crashes -- not before PHP or
     * the process does, which loses nothing that was committed. FULL is for
     * a database where that matters more than the writer's throughput.
     *
     * The file must exist unless $create says otherwise. Opening a mistyped
     * path made a fresh, empty database there, and every query then failed
     * with "no such table" far from the cause.
     *
     * Transactions begin IMMEDIATE unless $immediateTransactions says
     * otherwise. SQLite's default, DEFERRED, takes the write lock at the
     * first write, so a transaction that reads first holds a snapshot that
     * another worker's commit can overtake -- and then its write fails with
     * SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT at once, which the busy timeout does not wait
     * out, since waiting cannot make that snapshot current again. A
     * transaction() is a write by intent, so it takes the lock up front and
     * a second writer queues behind it under the busy timeout. postgres()
     * is untouched: under its default READ COMMITTED each statement reads a
     * fresh snapshot, and a second writer waits on the row lock instead.
     *
     * A write made through this connection -- a transaction() beginning, or
