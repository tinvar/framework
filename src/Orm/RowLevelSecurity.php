/**
 * Postgres row-level security for #[TenantScoped] tables: the policy that
 * reads the session variable PdoConnection keeps (see TenantSetting).
 *
 * The ORM already filters every query by the tenant and fails closed with
 * no tenant. This is the second layer, for whatever goes around the ORM --
 * raw SQL through connection(), a `whereRaw` subquery, a report someone
 * wrote by hand -- that forgot the predicate: the database still returns
 * only the tenant's rows, and none at all when no tenant is set.
 *
 * A migration applies it (ADR 0029): Table::tenant() on a table it makes,
 * Schema::tenantPolicy() on one that has its tenant column already, and
 * `make:migration` writes whichever a #[TenantScoped] table lacks.
 *
 * The policy is FORCEd, so the table's owner -- often the
 * application's own role -- is held to it too; a superuser or a role with
 * BYPASSRLS is not, whatever this does, so the application must not
 * connect as one.
 *
 * acrossTenants() lifts the policy as it lifts the ORM's filter, by a
 * second variable; withinSubtree() widens it to the tenants of a subtree
 * by a third, a Postgres array of them, empty -- and so matching nothing
 * -- outside one. A policy made before that third variable matches the
 * tenant alone: a read across a subtree there sees the parent's rows and
 * none of its children's until a migration makes the policy again. It is a guard against a forgotten predicate, not against
 * SQL injection: injected SQL can call set_config() as well as this class
 * can.
