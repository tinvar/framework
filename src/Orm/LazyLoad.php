/**
 * One lazy relation load the ORM ran -- one statement -- and whether it ran

 *
 * Decided in Orm::loadRelationRows(), from the parents it was handed:
 *
 *   - RENDER: Level 2. The BatchScheduler ran it at the end of a tick, for
 *     every parent the render's fibers awaited the relation on.
 *   - RESULT_SET: Level 1. It was for several parents -- the result set the
 *     one being read was hydrated in, or what of it had not loaded the
 *     relation yet -- or for a parent that is the whole of its result set,
 *     the one row a statement returned.
 *   - ALONE: for one parent by itself, because it was read in no result set
 *     of rows -- a #[BelongsTo] ghost, filled from its row alone, or a model
 *     attached to no set -- or because its siblings were not loaded with
 *     it: resolveHasMany()'s retry, after a batch that did not produce its
 *     rows. Read on each of N such parents, that is N statements: the 1+N
 *     the batching exists to prevent.
